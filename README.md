# CrowdFunding

This is a project my colleagues and I had to built for .Net Academy seminar! This seminar took place at Athens Tech College, organized by codehub.gr
(https://www.codehub.gr/learnprograms/?swoof=1&product_cat=net).

Crowdfunding project was built mainly for academic purposes and that's what we presented on the "graduation" day!

Technically, we use c#, asp.net core, jquery for building an application where someone would be able to login as a user, a future crowdfunder
or project creator. 

The project creator would be able to submit his idea asking for funding!

A Backer would be able to fund on the idea really liked it!

Search by name or project's category provided for helping people navigate through out the submited projects and have an eye on their
progress!

Are you an external site wanting our projects? No problem, we have a controller provides json object!
